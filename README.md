This is a Raspberry Pi project to connect a shock collar to discord. Continue with caution. I am not responsible for any injuries.

## Required Hardware

### Shock Collar
Order Your collar from [here](http://bit.ly/322H3Rz "http://bit.ly/322H3Rz"). Other collars might work, but don't chance it.
### Raspberry Pi
You will need a Raspberry Pi with the ability to connect to the internet. I have chosen the Pi Zero W for this project, but other models should also work. You will also need the following to use your pi:
* Micro USB power supply
* Micro USB OTG hub
* Mini HDMI adaptor
* MicroSD card loaded with NOOBS

You can get the kit I bought [here](https://amzn.to/2Hsg3Dj "https://amzn.to/2Hsg3Dj"). This kit includes all the basic accessories listed above.

### Accessories

 1. **433Mhz Transmitter**
	 * Needed to send signals to the collar

1. **Solderless Header**
	* **Note**: this only applies to the Raspberry Pi Zero W
	* If you can't solder, then I highly recommend this.

1. **Breadboard Kit**
	* This item is a bonus that is nice to have. It makes wiring up the transmitter easier, and will be useful for future projects.
	* if you don't want to buy this, then you will at least need some [Female-Female jumper wires](https://ebay.to/343p2Vp "https://ebay.to/343p2Vp") to connect to the transmitter.
